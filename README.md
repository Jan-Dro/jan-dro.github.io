# About Me

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jesus. Here, you'll get a glimpse into my world as a Software Engineer and explore some of the exciting projects I've worked on :D

## Who am I?

I'm a passionate engineer, just trying to help better the world around us a bit! My journey in this field began when I was about to get out of the army. I thought what do I want to do.. and well coding spoke to me, fastforward a few months later and my wife is pregnant! So i got into this just so I could better our lifestyle and so my kid can have a comfortable home :). Since then, I've been on a continuous journey to better myself daily!
